# Background

In this project, I set out to explore the question: How might we create a seamless and engaging experience for users to interact with a minimal and intuitive crypto wallet with Account Abstraction capability called "Sentry"?

### How might we...

- simplify the process of managing and accessing cryptocurrencies?
- create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface?
- cater to different preferences and interests of users?
- ensure secure and transparent transactions?

# Audience

Based on market research, I identified our main audience as crypto enthusiasts and investors. We broke those people down into a few different segments.

1. **First-time users**—New to cryptocurrencies, Curious individuals
2. **Experienced users**—Crypto traders, Investors, Blockchain developers
3. **Content creators**—Artists, Musicians, Game developers

# Brainstorming

First, we filled out empathy maps for three audiences: Crypto Wallet Users, Blockchain Developers, and Platform Owners. A significant takeaway from this exercise is that we needed to understand the platform's perspective more.

After, we brainstormed problem statements. We picked out the problems we were most interested in and put them into buckets: How might we make crypto transactions accessible and secure? How might we provide a personalized experience for users? How might we measure user satisfaction and platform growth?

Using these prompts, we brainstormed quick ideas for solutions. Looking back, a lot of our ideas from this brainstorming session made their way into our MVP.

# Professional interviews

Based on our exercise, I realized I needed to understand the platform's point of view more, so I set up interviews with professionals who worked with or at these organizations. These interviews were to empathize with a new audience, but I was also looking to potentially partner with an existing crypto wallet platform to execute the project.

# Implementation

Once we decided on this direction, we designed the prototype iteratively based on user feedback and testing.
