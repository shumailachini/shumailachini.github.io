# Background

In early 2023, I set out to explore the question: How might we create a seamless and engaging experience for users to discover, buy, and sell NFTs on a marketplace called NFTSpace?

### How might we...

- simplify the process of buying and selling NFTs?
- create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface?
- cater to different preferences and interests of users?
- ensure secure and transparent transactions?
- provide educational resources for new users?
- enable social sharing and interactions among users?

# Audience

Based on market research, we identified our main audience as NFT enthusiasts and collectors. We broke those people down into a few different segments.

1. **First-time users**—New to NFTs, Curious individuals
2. **Experienced users**—NFT collectors, Digital artists, Investors
3. **Content creators**—Artists, Musicians, Game developers

# Brainstorming

First, we filled out empathy maps for three audiences: NFT Buyers, NFT Sellers, and Platform Owners. A significant takeaway from this exercise is that we needed to understand the platform's perspective more.

After, we brainstormed problem statements. We picked out the problems we were most interested in and put them into buckets: How might we make NFT transactions accessible and secure? How might we provide a personalized experience for users? How might we measure user satisfaction and platform growth?

Using these prompts, we brainstormed quick ideas for solutions. Looking back, a lot of our ideas from this brainstorming session made their way into our MVP.

# Professional interviews

Based on our exercise, we realized we needed to understand the platform's point of view more, so we set up interviews with professionals who worked with or at these organizations. These interviews were to empathize with a new audience, but we were also looking to potentially partner with an existing NFT platform to execute the project.

# Proof of concept

Over about 3 weeks, we established the information architecture, sketched wireframes, and started preliminary designs for the NFTSpace app.

# Working with NFT platforms

About halfway through the project, we decided to move forward with using open APIs from popular NFT marketplaces and designing the experience around their data.

# Implementation

Once we decided on this direction, we designed the prototype iteratively based on user feedback and testing. Some ideas we explored in this phase included:

**Blockchain integration** — We explored integrating various blockchain networks to support a wide range of NFTs and ensure secure transactions.

**Personalized recommendations** — Using machine learning algorithms, we could tailor recommendations based on users' preferences and browsing history.

**Educational resources** — By providing easy-to-understand resources and tutorials, we aimed to make the platform more accessible for new users.

**Social features** — We integrated social sharing and interaction options, allowing users to share their collections, follow other users, and engage in discussions.

**Advanced search and filtering** — By offering advanced search options and filters, users can easily find NFTs that match their preferences and budget.
